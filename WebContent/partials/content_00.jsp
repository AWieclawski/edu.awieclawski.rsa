		<p>The example web application prepared for those who wish to
			understand better the workings of the RSA Public Key Encryption /
			Decryption scheme.</p>
		<p>The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this
			means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different,
			mathematically linked keys). As their names suggest, a public key is
			shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared
			with anyone.</p>
		<p>The RSA algorithm is named after those who invented it in 1978:
			Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.</div>
